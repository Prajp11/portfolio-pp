            About Me !
          </h1>
          <p>
            Hi there! Iâ€™m Prajwal Pandgale, a <b>Web Developer</b> from Pune, India. 
            My journey in tech has been shaped by working with <b>Java, HTML, CSS, Spring Boot, JavaScript, SQL</b> and <b>Mainframe Technologies.</b> 
            <br />
            <br />I love diving into projects that challenge me and push the envelope on design and functionality. 
            Creating user-friendly and innovative solutions is what drives me. I am always excited to do experiments with new technologies and find fresh ways to solve problems. If you check out my projects, you'll see how I turn ideas into reality with a blend of creativity and technical expertise.
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />I am <b>open</b> to new opportunities and collaborations where I can contribute and grow. Feel free to connect with me, links are in the footer.
            <br />
            Apart from coding, I enjoy exploring new technologies and working on personal projects to enhance my skills.
